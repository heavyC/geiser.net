<FONT SIZE=+5>T</FONT>here's a restless alchemy in David Geiser's painting --
as if the substrata or pigment and thought are about to burst through the
heavy layered surfaces
and reinvent themselves.  All combinations are possible: this is a universe
of unlimited, if chaotic, potential.
<P>
Geiser, himself, works in a shaman's studio, surrounded by the ceremonial
masks and totems familiar to the trade.  Emblematic circles of gold are
strong signifiers in past and present images.  In the nooks and corners
of the studio stand earlier works: paintings of large and darkly brooding
fossilized shapes, obscure references to primal creatures; elegiac reminders
of previous investigations.
<P>
The bones and ashes of these primal images lie buried beneath the surface
of his latest work -- big, exuberant explorations of the nature of paint,
rich and juicy, oozing onto a color field of royal blue,
or spilling over gobs of sandstone laced with crimson.  So metabolic
and tactile is his mix of organic materials (such as dirt and clay
with rhoplex and pigment), that Geiser could easily be dismissed as a
sensualist were it not for the informed intelligence that breathes life
into these lush compositions.

Archetypal fragments emerge: remnants of myths and systems of composition
gleaned from sources as far apart as the physical sciences, ancient
citystates, or Western art history.
The splash and scape gestures of the abstract expressionism recombine
with the organizational space and high-toned spirituality of the early
Italian renaissance.  A gritty, underlying sense of decay recalls the
German postmodernist painters such as Anselm Keifer.
<P>
In "Blood Cenote," for instance, the familiar motifs of circles and grid,
the crimson and gold are embedded references to ancient sites, sacred and
secular, and to myths half remembered within the universal psyche.
Cenote refers to an ancient Mexican method of water collection: a large
basin carved out of rock that because of its very necessity transforms
itself into a sacred site as well. The metaphors start to flow and the
entire painting is an evocation of human upheaval: of change and
transformation.
<P>
For Geiser is, above all, a painter's painter, consumed and obsessed
with the mystery of paint and its evocation of a state of being:
tactile, emotional, and intelligent reference
to the universe. At his best, he balances precariously between a
sensual outpouring of gestural heroics and the stoic underpinnings
of grid and  informed composition. Whatever metaphors or paradigms
we impose on this work, its potency lies in Geiser's ability to understand
and emphatically communicate the essential nature of art-making: its mutable
sensibilities; the risky balance between thought
and gesture.
<P>
Shown recently at the Kim Foster Gallery in Soho, an exhibit of his recent
paintings moves on to the Butters Gallery in Portland, Oregon in June.
