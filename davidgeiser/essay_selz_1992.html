	<FONT SIZE="+2"><B>T</B></FONT>he initial impression of David Geiser's paintings is their physical appearance,
	the palpability of the work. These pieces reveal their manual construction, the process
	that brought them into being. In contrast to the carefully calculated synthetic surfaces
	that are so prevalent at this time, they are tough, unruly pieces, crafted by hand. Geiser
	paints his organic images on hand-laminated paper, on boards, tarpaulins or on unstretched
	canvas. Sometimes he will construct a work in incremental pieces of wood, which can be
	arranged in various ways and the organization altered. The parts are fastened together in
	disjointed compositions which retain their organic edges--their hand-fabricated appearance.
	Sometimes panels are accreted into polyptychs, or they are piled on top of each other like so
	many cobblestones. David Geiser creates the surface by applying paint in many layers, and
	he is then likely to agitate the heavy surfaces by pulling, tearing, gouging, scouring, sanding
	and drilling holes. The finished work is the result of making and unmaking, of growth and decay.

	<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>H</B></FONT>e uses the information he has gathered from biology and mathematics to create rough
	mosaics which dialectically fuse these areas of investigation into the actual paintings. The
	paint itself often looks like a chemical sediment, or it may resemble the tectonics of geological
	formations. It evokes not only the growth and deterioration in the natural world, but also the
	industrial waste created by the hand of man. Combined with his consuming interest in the
	world of nature is Geiser's daily life in the grind of the urban center. Much of his work relates
	to the waste and decay found in the modern city-especially New York with its garish energy
	and vernacular power. Geiser's work is as informed by the detritus of the gritty city as it is by
	natural configurations.

	<P>
	<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>B</B></FONT>asic to David Geiser's enterprise is his concern with biomorphic principles as well as with
	parallel mathematical structures. Aware of the connection between biological and mathematical
 systems, he seeks to create works of art which manifest a structural organic image. He probes the
 phenomena of nature: cloud formations, whirlwinds, anatomical structures. At the same time he
 studies thought processes such as predictability (and unpredictability) and chaos theory. At times
 we are reminded of the Mandelbrot Set and the work of Chaos scientists, who find the random
 order in clouds, trees, mountain ranges and the sea more revealing than the purity of Euclidian forms.

 <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>I</B></FONT>n David Geiser's studio, masks and weapons from Africa and Oceania and Mexican
 ceremonial masks share space with pine cones, dried spiny insects and animal skeletons.
 He learns from the morphology of plants and animals and admires aboriginal art. He also
 refers back to early Flemish painting, particularly the raucous iconography of Bosch and Breughel.
 And, as Robert Motherwell pointed out: "Every intelligent painter carries the whole culture of
 modern painting in his head." Geiser esteems in particular the frottages and decalcomanias of
 Max Ernst which suggest telluric fantasies without preconceived intention as well as the possibilities
 of automatic drawing. He is attracted to the hautes pates of Jean Dubuffet's art brut, of his pastes
 consisting of putty, asphalt, concrete and glue. He also feels an affinity for Atoni Tapies's heavy
 matter paintings which were done spontaneously on a geometric grid.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>I</B></FONT>n his application of natural substances such as pitch, wax, encaustic graphite or powdered
 pigments in oil medium, David Geiser displays a preference for earth colors which are often
 interspersed with blue, silver, gold and black. Blue for him recalls relics, robes and vestments,
 and he sees it also as the color of intellectual pursuit. Gold and silver are metallic colors, and he
 prefers using them in their laminated state. Most of his pieces are dark. Black is the pigment which
 often occupies the central core of his large paintings.

 <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>A</B></FONT>lthough objects, such as helmets, cages and weapons appear in Geiser's paintings,
 most of his recent work takes reference to horns, wings, tubers, corals, and--above all--the form
 of the spiral as found in the nautilus shell. The spiral has reappeared throughout history as a symbol
 of growth and is found in many ancient tribal cultures as separated as the Maoris and the Celts.
 Unlike the closed circle which has the beauty of symmetry, the spiral is the sign of the sublime,
 the mysterious, the unfolding. For Valdimir Tatlin, when designing the "Monument to the Third
 International," it was the positive symbol of a modern dynamic, revolutionary culture. For Robert
 Smithson, on the other hand, the "Spiral Jetty" signified the laws of entropy, the constant and
 irreversible loss of energy, while for William Blake, it was Jacob's Ladder, leading to heaven.
 To David Geiser, I believe, it denotes the basic life force of nature, visible in biological structures
 and manifest in the organizations of human thought.
