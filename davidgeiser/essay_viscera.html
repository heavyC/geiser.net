New York painter David Geiser produces work that explodes with
drama, viscera, sensuality and several other qualities in short
supply at the gutless 2003 Oregon Biennial--and arguably in
the Northwest art scene as a whole. Harrell Fletcher, Brad
Adkins, Amos Latteier and others of the unassuming
artiste-as-mensch axis would well aspire to Geiser&#39;s
extroversion and fearlessness as a painter and thinker.
<P>
After living in SoHo, Geiser and his wife, actress Mercedes
Ruehl, recently moved into a home a mile away from Jackson
Pollock and Lee Krasner&#39;s one-time <i>pied-&agrave;-terre</i> in the East
Hamptons. The painter jokes that ever since the move, the Ghost
of Abstract Expressionism Past has been haunting his studio.
I spoke with Geiser by phone as he finished up preparing for
his September show at Butters Gallery, where one of his
paintings, <i>Red Thorn I</i>, now hangs in a group show.
<P>
<B>Willamette Week: Do you consider yourself a neo-Expressionist?</b>
<p>
David Geiser: The way I work is a blend of Abstract Expressionism
and the element of surprise or the subconscious, like the automatic
painting of the Surrealists. It&#39;s abstract--it&#39;s not pretending
to be a face or a human being--but it&#39;s coming from a real place;
it&#39;s a real thing; it&#39;s paint on wood. And it can evoke
something universal like ether or something primal like mold
growing on a piece of bread. God is in these things.
<p>
<B>You&#39;re familiar with the whole &quot;finish fetish&quot; movement
in painting, where painters obsess over getting these
preternaturally smooth surfaces?</B>
<p>
Sure.
<p>
<B>But you really exploit surface. Your canvasses
look like you splatter them with blood and guts.</B>
<p>
I really strive for that, which is one reason I think
oil paint is the only real paint to work with. It&#39;s
where the real story is. It&#39;s a metabolism that somehow
connects with human metabolism. The thing that&#39;s always
moved me about paint is that pigment is earth in solution.
<p>
<B>When you say, &quot;the metabolism of paint,&quot; what do you mean by that?</B>
<p>
With each material I use--varnishes, turpentines,
linseed oils--there&#39;s a different drying process. As
they dry and pool, they take on a life of their own,
and there seems to be a metabolism in how they move,
which I discover by a sort of alchemical trial and error.
The canvas becomes a petri dish, and you see what grows
out of it.
<p>
<B>You&#39;re well-known nationally and internationally,
but you come to Portland every year and have been for,
what, 15 years or so?</B>
<p>
Right, since the inception of Butters Gallery, and
it&#39;s been a wonderful journey. Jeff Butters has an
extraordinary eye and sensitivity, and I love the
physicality of Oregon, the ruggedness of the coast.
And in terms of Portland, for a relatively small city,
it has an amazingly good intellectual profile and
collector base.
<p>
<B>The Oregon Biennial is up now, and it&#39;s troubling
to see what a lot of young artists are coming up with:
these Fraggle Rock-looking puppets and cutesy work that&#39;s
reaching for whimsy, as if our generation is reliving
Saturday-morning cartoons in lieu of making serious art.</B>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of that goofy pop imagery now. It&#39;s
throwaway, often somebody else&#39;s throwaway, reconstituted.
That&#39;s why you don&#39;t hang in front of an art work for a
long time anymore. There&#39;s no resonance that compels you
to stay there. It&#39;s like flipping through the channels of
TV. So many artists have lost sight of what the possibilities
are. Everybody&#39;s looking at the next big thing, trying to get
their foot in the door instead of exploring who they are.
As an artist you don&#39;t just reflect pop culture and the
banality of existence; you&#39;ve got to show that there&#39;s
something extraordinary here, not just an easy-access image.
<p>
<B>That&#39;s certainly a Romantic conception of the artist.</B>
<p>
Christ, that&#39;s the only thing left! I don&#39;t want cool
and glib and wry and absurd reflected back at me! I want
to go beyond, into that mystery and magic that compels
you to look at a sunset or the serpentine rivers underneath
you when you&#39;re flying in a plane. It&#39;s the theories of
Expressionism versus Pop; it&#39;s passion versus soup cans.
But you know, the worse things get in the art world, the
more potency I have in my work. We should be out there,
feeling self-righteous, carrying the spear into war.
It shouldn&#39;t come easy.
