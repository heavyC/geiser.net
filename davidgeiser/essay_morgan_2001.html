David Geiser loves to be around nature. He goes to his
cabin in the woods and he fishes. He likes the fresh water
scent and the isolation, the concentration, and the necessity
to remain alert. The mist from a river happens through the
refraction of light. His paintings are therefore an interpretation
of this process of refraction. But it is not at all representational.
These panels exist beyond representation. They have a method
- a serious investigation of color tones and values, of
glazes, subtle pours and drips, even subtler manipulation
of linear forms and amorphous shapes caught within the essential
stillness of painting.
<p>
Geiser wants the work to sing. It does. Look at the earlier
&quot;Cenote Series&quot; - the large circles - perhaps
reminiscent of early sculpture by Richard Serra. The panels-the
parts in relation to the whole-are not incidental to how
the painting is structured. They exist of necessity. They
are part of what makes the painting significant, what gives
the painting its expressive energy.
Geiser's work is always on time, always engaged in a process
of temporality and transference, transference from the world
of nature, the world of eternal struggle, to some wondrous
outward manifestation. They are not paintings that project
a mood so much as paintings that give vitality and meaning
to a world that has (temporarily?) lost its sense of tactile
response to the intimate phenomena of everyday life. Geiser's
paintings help restore a sense
of intimacy to the world-a tall order that only a painter
who has a vision can achieve. David Geiser is such a painter.
