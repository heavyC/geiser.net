	Forget what you know about flowers
	<P>
	In "NEOBOTANICA: Flora by Four Contemporary Artists," an exhibit at the
	Jacksonville Museum of Art that began yesterday and runs through Jan. 18,
	pristine petals and delicate forms give way to edgy shapes and raw symbolism
	The exhibit showcases the diverse styles of David Collins and David Geiser,
	both from New York, Timothy McDowell of Connecticut and Barbara Rogers of
	Arizona. And each artist approaches nature in a slick and contemporary way
	Traditional still life images slide away. Burnt sienna, dusty orange and midnight
	hues replace traditional bright reds and greens.
	<P>
	"Artists throughout history have been using flowers as inspiration for art,"
	said George Kinghorn, curator of the exhibition. "But the way these artists
	have approached the subject is in very different ways. These images are much
	more thought-provoking."

	For example, in Rogers' <I>Emblems of a Microcosm</I>, both beauty
	and hostility pervade. Vegetational forms overlap vinelike tendrils
	that dance among dark passages and illuminated spaces. The painting
	symbolizes the artist's own desire for inner peace, in a world full of
	tempest.
	<P>
	"It's both beautiful and sinister in the same instance," Kinghorn said.
	<P>
	The atmosphere in David Collins' painting differs. Influenced by ancient
	Buddhist paintings, American quilt patterns and graphic media, Collins
	uses both powdery and bold colors to animate images that suspend in space.
	His botanicals resemble chrysanthemums and lotus flowers that float on
	the canvas.
	<P>
	In all the works, Kinghorn points out the botanical images hover in space
	with no reference to a ground plane or directional horizon. Spatial dynamics
	are challenged, and there is a quality of abstract realism in each piece.
	<P>
	Fluctuating between the familiar and the abstract, Timothy McDowell's
	paintings layer plant matter in intricate ways. In <I>Treacle and Spice</I>,
	the artist paints pitch black plant pieces amidst a blush background.
	He uses encaustic, a blend of beeswax, pigment and glue to create deep
	and luminous surfaces.
	<P>
	There is also a radiant quality in the works of David Geiser. To produce
	images that resemble geological finds and fused fossils, Geiser affixes torn
	parchment for a grainy background. The result is an abstract garden of seed
	pods, leafy forms and jagged brushstrokes of mossy green that combine and
	radiate in earth tones,
	<P>
	"Geiser's linear forms are not merely illustrations of botanicals, but rather
	organic forms filtered through the artist's intellect," Kinghorn said.
	<P>
	For this exhibit, Kinghorn chose from a pool of 30 national artists who
	submitted their work.
	<P>
	"This is definitely an exhibit for lovers of painting," he said. "As a subject
	for observance, nature is limitless for providing inspiration."
